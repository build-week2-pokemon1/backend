# backend

Hello! Welcome to the API for our Pokemon Project for Lambda School Build Week. 

The backend is a REST API that handles user sign-ups and logins, and sending Pokemon data from our Mongo database to the frontend of our application. 

Visit the frontend of our application [here](https://elastic-payne-ec3741.netlify.com/) 
or, using Postman, make requests to https://pokemon-backend-lsbw.herokuapp.com/.
